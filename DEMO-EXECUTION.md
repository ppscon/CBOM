# FIPS 140-3 CBOM Demo Execution Guide

## Quick Start

```bash
# Make script executable (first time only)
chmod +x demo-run-pipelines.sh

# Run compliant pipeline (PASS scenario)
./demo-run-pipelines.sh compliant

# Run violations pipeline (FAIL scenario)
./demo-run-pipelines.sh violations

# Run both pipelines
./demo-run-pipelines.sh both
```

## Important: Demo Mode with `continue-on-error`

**This pipeline uses `continue-on-error: true` to demonstrate ALL pipeline stages.**

### What You'll See:

1. **Aqua Scan** - May fail (FIPS 140-3 score < 5 is very strict)
2. **CBOM Generation** - Succeeds (detects cryptographic algorithms)
3. **REGO Evaluation** - **FAILS with violations** üõë
   - Shows: "‚ùå FIPS 140-3 COMPLIANCE FAILED: 6 violation(s) detected"
   - Shows: "üõë PIPELINE BLOCKED - Image does NOT meet FIPS 140-3 cryptographic requirements"
   - Shows: "üõë Image will NOT be pushed to registry"
4. **Push Image** - Skipped due to REGO failure

### Demo Talking Points (Reference Screenshots):

#### Stage 2: Aqua Image Assurance Scan

**"First, let's look at what Aqua Security found..."**

**Aqua Scan Results:**
- **Disallowed: true** - Image failed Aqua's FIPS Image Assurance policy
- **Policy: fips-140-3-image-compliance**
- Aqua detected vulnerabilities and policy violations
- "This is our first layer of defense - traditional CVE and policy scanning"
- "Notice it caught issues, but we continue for demo purposes (`continue-on-error: true`)"
- "In production, this would also be a blocking gate"

**Why continue?**
- "FIPS 140-3 requires CVSS score < 5 (very strict)"
- "We want to demonstrate the SECOND layer: cryptographic compliance via CBOM/REGO"
- "This is where we detect specific algorithmic violations - not just CVEs"

---

#### Stage 4: REGO Cryptographic Compliance Check

**"Now let's see what the REGO policy detected in the CBOM..."**

**Lines 42-52: REGO Evaluation Results**
- "The policy evaluated the CBOM and found **6 critical violations**"
- "Line 43: CBOM shows **627 out of 628 assets are quantum-vulnerable**"
- "Lines 44-45: **MD5 detected** in Gruntfile.js and lib/insecurity.ts - NOT FIPS 140-3 approved"
- "Lines 46-48: Quantum-vulnerable cryptography detected:"
  - MD5 in Gruntfile.js (Grover's Algorithm + Broken)
  - SHA-3 in frontend/989.js (Grover's Algorithm)
  - MD5 in lib/insecurity.ts (Grover's Algorithm + Broken)

**Lines 53-67: Security Gate Response**
- "Line 60: ‚ùå **FIPS 140-3 COMPLIANCE FAILED: 6 violation(s) detected**"
- "Line 61: üõë **PIPELINE BLOCKED** - Image does NOT meet FIPS 140-3 requirements"
- "Line 62: üõë **Image will NOT be pushed to registry**"
- "Lines 65-67: Action required - remediate violations before re-deployment"

**Production vs Demo:**
- "In production, we'd remove `continue-on-error` and this would be a **hard stop**"
- "For this demo, we override to show all pipeline stages and capabilities"
- "The security gate is working - it detected deprecated MD5 and quantum-vulnerable algorithms"

## Defense-in-Depth: Two-Layer Security Model

This pipeline implements a **defense-in-depth** approach with two complementary security gates:

### Layer 1: Aqua Image Assurance (Traditional Security)
- ‚úÖ CVE vulnerability scanning
- ‚úÖ Malware detection
- ‚úÖ CIS benchmarks
- ‚úÖ Package compliance
- ‚úÖ Maximum CVSS score < 5 (FIPS requirement)
- **Focus:** Known vulnerabilities and configuration issues

### Layer 2: CBOM + REGO (Cryptographic Compliance)
- ‚úÖ Cryptographic Bill of Materials (CBOM) generation
- ‚úÖ Algorithm detection (MD5, SHA-1, AES, RSA, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Deprecated algorithm blocking (MD5, 3DES, RC4)
- ‚úÖ Quantum vulnerability assessment
- ‚úÖ FIPS 140-3 algorithmic compliance
- **Focus:** Cryptographic weaknesses and future threats

### Why Both?

**Aqua alone** catches traditional security issues but may miss:
- Use of deprecated cryptographic algorithms
- Quantum-vulnerable encryption
- Non-FIPS approved crypto implementations

**CBOM/REGO** catches cryptographic-specific issues:
- MD5 usage (even if no CVE)
- Quantum-vulnerable algorithms (secure today, vulnerable post-quantum)
- FIPS 140-3 algorithm compliance

**Together:** Complete coverage of both traditional security AND cryptographic compliance.

## Demo Scenario: Cryptographic Violations Detection

**Command:**
```bash
./demo-run-pipelines.sh violations
```

**What happens:**
1. Scans juice-shop image
2. Aqua scan: **FAILS** (continues for demo)
3. CBOM generation: **SUCCEEDS** (finds MD5, SHA-3)
4. REGO evaluation: **FAILS** (6 violations detected)
   - MD5 (deprecated algorithm)
   - 627/628 assets quantum-vulnerable
5. Image push: **BLOCKED** üõë

**Demonstrates:**
- Cryptographic compliance gate working
- REGO policy detecting violations
- Security gate prevents deployment

## Manual Trigger (GitHub UI)

### Compliant Pipeline:
1. Go to: https://github.com/ppscon/CBOM/actions
2. Select "CBOM FIPS 140-3 Compliant Pipeline (PASS Demo)"
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Select branch: `master`
5. Click "Run workflow"

### Violations Pipeline:
Automatically triggers on push to master:
```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "demo: trigger violations pipeline"
git push
```

---

## Watching Pipeline Progress

```bash
# List recent runs
./demo-run-pipelines.sh list

# Watch specific run
./demo-run-pipelines.sh watch <run-id>

# Or use gh CLI directly
gh run watch --exit-status
```

---

## Demo Talking Points

### For Compliant Pipeline:
- "This is our baseline - a minimal, compliant image"
- "Notice the CBOM shows zero cryptographic findings"
- "All gates pass - this is our gold standard"
- "Image is successfully pushed and ready for deployment"

### For Violations Pipeline:
- "Now let's scan a real-world application - OWASP Juice Shop"
- "CBOM detects MD5 - a deprecated algorithm not FIPS-approved"
- "627 out of 628 cryptographic assets are quantum-vulnerable"
- "REGO policy blocks the push - security gate working as designed"
- "In production, developers would need to remediate before re-deployment"

## Troubleshooting

### Pipeline not starting:
```bash

gh auth login
```

### Can't find run ID:
```bash
# List all recent runs
gh run list --limit 10
```

### Watch command fails:

FIPS 140-3 CBOM Demo Pipeline Runner

Usage:
  $0 compliant      Run compliant pipeline (PASS scenario)
  $0 violations     Run violations pipeline (FAIL scenario)
  $0 both           Run both pipelines sequentially
  $0 watch <id>     Watch a specific pipeline run
  $0 list           List recent pipeline runs
  $0 help           Show this help message

Examples:
  # Run compliant demo (all gates pass)
  $0 compliant

  # Run violations demo (REGO blocks push)
  $0 violations

  # Run full demo (both scenarios)
  $0 both

  # Watch a specific run
  $0 watch 12345678

Demo Workflow:
  1. Run 'compliant' to show successful compliance
  2. Run 'violations' to show security gate blocking
  3. Compare results in GitHub Actions UI
